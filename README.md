walkthroughs for the Beginner Challenges in the US Cyber Games Season IV CTF

This was the most difficult CTF event that I ahve entered. It was a blast but very challenging. I worked with some new tools and gained a bunch of experience. I even had1 challenege that is haunting me still (All Hashed Out) that I did not solve and I'm waiting for walkthroughs to get posted.
